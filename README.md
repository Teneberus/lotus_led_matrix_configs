# LOTUS LED Matrix Configuration Files

## I don't know what this is...

Take a look at the [LOTUS Lexicon](https://www.lotus-simulator.de/lexikon/index.php?entry/321-led-matrix-en/).

## What's what?

*group_strings.ini* contains the group strings of the special pis.
The directory *xml* contains the xml configs for the stop strings sorted by the terminus code.

*group_strings.ini* and *xml* are for the default special pis class *LED_BERLIN*.
The ones with the suffixes *_2014* and *_2018* are for *LED_BERLIN_2014* and *LED_BERLIN_2018*.

## How to use them?

Well... What do you think?
